# Week 1

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Historical Context - MacKenzie

- Human factors is both a science and a field of engineering. It is concerned with
human capabilities, limitations, and performance, and with the design of systems
that are efficient, safe, comfortable, and even enjoyable for the humans who use
them.
- HCI, then, is human factors, but narrowly focused on human interaction with
computing technology of some sort. That said, HCI itself does not feel “narrowly focused.” On the contrary, HCI is tremendously broad in scope. It draws upon interests and expertise in disciplines such as
psychology (particularly cognitive psychology and experimental psychology), sociology, anthropology, cognitive science, computer science, and linguistics.
- **User study** - in this book refers to an experiment with human participants
- HCI emerged in the 1980s, the discipline most central to HCI is _human factors_ or _ergonomics_


### Notable Events

- **Vannevar Bush** - had ideas about storing and accessing information like what we are currently able to do with the internet. Bush proposed navigating the knowledge maze with a device he called memex. Among the features of memex is associative indexing, whereby points of interest can be connected and joined so that selecting one item immediately and automatically selects another.
- **Sketchpad** - Proposed by Ivan sutherlandthe first _direct manipulation_ interface. The use of a pointing device for input makes Sketchpad the first direct manipulation interface—a sign of things to come
- **Douglas Engelbart** - invented the mouse in 1963. Won turing award in 1997 and SIGCHI Lifetime achievement award.
- **Xerox Star** - novel feature of the _desktop metaphor_. Metaphors are important in HCI. When a metaphor is present, the user has a jump-start on knowing what to do. The user exploits existing knowledge from another domain. The desktop
metaphor brings concepts from the office desktop to the system’s display.
- **SIGCHI** - Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (1982)
- **The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction** - written by Card, Moran, and Newell; connects low-level human processes with interactions humans have with computers. The framework for this was the model human processor (MHP).
	- Newell astutely identifies a dilemma in the field: experimentation cannot be done until it is too late. As he put
it, the system is built and the degrees of freedom are bound. This is an overstatement, perhaps, but it is true that novel interactions in new products always seem to be followed by a flurry of research papers identifying weaknesses and suggesting and evaluating improvements.
	- This is very important part of the chapter and must read.
	- **MHP** - _model human processor_	
	- **KLM** - _keystroke-level model_

## The Psychopathology Of Everyday Things - Don Norman

### Topic: psychopathology of everyday things.

### Discoverability and Understanding
- Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? 
- Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
	- The doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverability fails.
	- With complex devices, discoverability and understanding require the aid of manuals or personal instruction. We accept this if the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary for simple things. 

### Types of Designs

The major areas of design relevant to this book are industrial design, interaction design, and experience design. None of the fields is well defined, but the focus of the efforts does vary, with industrialone designers emphasizing form and material, interactive designers emphasizing understandability and usability, and experience designers emphasizing the emotional impact


- **Industrial design** - the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
- **Interaction design** - the focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience
- **Experience design** - the practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience
- Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology


### Errors in Design - 3 Mile Island

- My work with that committee (American nuclear power) of changed my view of design. Today, I realize that design presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology, that the designers must understand both. 
- The operators were blamed for these failures: “human error” was the immediate analysis. But the committee I was on discovered that the plant’s control rooms were so poorly designed that error was inevitable: design was at fault, not the operators. The moral was simple: we were designing things for people, so we needed to understand both technology and people. But that’s a difficult step for many engineers: machines are so logical, so orderly. If we didn’t have people, everything would work so much better. Yup, that’s how I used to think

### Error v/s Engineers

Engineers still tend to believe in logic. They often explain to me in great, logical detail, why their designs are good, powerful, and wonderful. 
- “Why are people having problems?” they wonder. “You are being too logical,” I say. “You are designing for people the
way you would like them to be, not for the way they really are.”
- When the engineers object, I ask whether they have ever made an error, perhaps turning on or off the wrong light, or the wrong8 The Design of Everyday Things stove burner. “Oh yes,” they say, “but those were errors.” That’s
the point: even experts make errors. So we must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors
- 

### Human Centered Design
- It is an an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology. 
- Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible,
what is happening, and what is about to happen. Communication is especially important when things go wrong. It is relatively easy to design things that work smoothly and harmoniously long as things go right. 
- But as soon as there is a problem or a misunderstanding, the problems arise. This is where good design
is essential. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned.
- Actually, this is where the most satisfaction can arise: when something goes wrong but the machine highlights the problems, then the person understands the issue, takes the proper actions, and the problem is solved. When this happens smoothly, the collaboration of person and device feels wonderful.
- Human-centered design is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet.

### Priciples of Interaction
- Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their interactions. Was the overall experience positive, or was it frustrating and confusing? When our home technology behaves in an uninterpretable fashion we can become confused, frustrated, and even angry—all strong negative emotions.
- Discoverability results from five fundamental psychological concepts: _affordances_, _signifiers_, _constraints_, _mappings_, and _feedback_; there is also another more important principle called _conceptual model_ of the system
- **Affordances** - The term affordance refers to the relationship between a physical object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could
possibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore, affords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single person (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong person or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people cannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have
that affordance, it does not afford lifting
	- **Percieved affordances** - often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous. See case study.
- **Signifiers** - signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done; signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place.
We need both.
- **Mapping** - Mapping is an important concept in the design and layout of controls and displays. When the mapping uses spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls and the devices being controlled, it is easy to determine how to use them. In steering a car, we rotate the steering wheel clockwise to cause the car to turn right: the top of the wheel moves in the same direction as the car
	- Natural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of spatial analogies, leads to immediate understanding. For example, to move an object up, move the control up. To make it easy to determine which control works which light in a large room or auditorium, arrange the controls in the same pattern as the lights.
- **Feedback** - Feedback—communicating the results of an action—is a wellknown concept from the science of control and information theory.
	- Feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting. If the delay is too long, people often give up, going off to do other activities.
	- Too much feedback can be even more annoying than too little. My dishwasher likes to beep at three a.m. to tell me that the wash is done, defeating my goal of having it work in the middle of the night so as not to disturb anyone (and to use less expensive electricity)
	- Poor design of feedback can be the result of decisions aimed at reducing costs, even if they make life more difficult for people. Rather than use multiple signal lights, informative displays, or rich, musical sounds with varying patterns, the focus upon cost reduction forces the design to use a single light or sound to convey multiple types of information
	- Feedback has to be planned. All actions need to be confirmed, but in a manner that is unobtrusive. Feedback must also be prioritized, so that unimportant information is presented in an unobtrusive fashion, but important signals are presented in a way that does capture attention

### Conceptual Models
- A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesn’t have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful. The files, folders, and icons you see displayed on a computer screen help people create the conceptual model of documents and folders inside the computer, or of apps or applications residing on the screen, waiting to be summoned
- There are often multiple conceptual models of a product or device. People’s conceptual models for the way that regenerative braking in a hybrid or electrically powered automobile works are quite different for average drivers than for technically sophisticated drivers, different again for whoever must service the system, and yet different again for those who designed the system.
- The major clues to how things work come from their perceived structure—in particular from signifiers, affordances, constraints, and mappings
- What happens when the device does not suggest a good conceptual model? Consider my digital watch with five buttons: two along the top, two along the bottom, and one on the left side (Figure 1.8). What is each button for? How would you set the time? There is no way to tell—no evident relationship between the operating controls and the functions, no constraints, no apparent mappings.

### System Image
- People create mental models of themselves, others, the environment, and the things with which they interact. These are conceptual models formed through experience, training, and instruction. These models serve as guides to help achieve our goals and in understanding the world
- what the device looks like, what we know from using similar things in the past, what was told to us in the sales literature, by salespeople and advertisements, by articles we may have read, by the product website and instruction manuals. I call the combined information available to us the system image.
